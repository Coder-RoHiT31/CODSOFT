To use this:

-> The program will still need an internet connection to fetch rates
-> It handles the same major currencies as before
-> Basic error messages are displayed if something goes wrong
-> The conversion math remains accurate
-> This version is more suitable for environments where you can't add external libraries or want to keep dependencies minimal. The JSON parsing is basic but works for this specific API response format. For production use with more complex needs, consider using a proper JSON library.
